2. Description:
The “vPublic_PresubmissionCommunityMeetings” dataset gives details of the community meetings held in Howard County. The dataset contains details of all the meetings that were held in HoCo between 2002 and October 2015, with each meeting being identified by a project name and a unique project id. Each project contains information about the meeting date and time as well as address and city of the meeting location. The meetings have been held in each of the following cities : Annapolis, Brookeville, Clarksville, Columbia, Cooksville, Dayton, Elkridge, Ellicott City, Fulton, Glenelg, Glenwood, Hanover, Highland, Jessup, Laurel, Lisbon, Marriottsville, Mount Airy, Savage, Sykesville, (West Friendship), Woodbine, Woodstock.

Howard County Maryland (2015). MARC Stations [Data file]. Retrieved from https://data.howardcountymd.gov/

Description:
MARC (Maryland Area Regional Commuter Train Service) is a commuter rail system that serves the state of Maryland along with a few other regions. The “MARC Stations” dataset gives the name of the MARC stations along with details of the street and city the station is located in. Each station has a zipcode and geometric location associated with it. 

4. RESEARCH QUESTIONS:

1. Are community meetings held more frequently in areas with higher population than those with lower population? (Combining dataset 1 and 2)
2. Are community meetings held more frequently in areas that have MARC stations as compared to those that do not? (Combining dataset 1 and 3)

Rationale: One of the primary goals of the community meetings is to increase the number of people who attend these meetings. Conducting meetings in areas with high population increases the chances of having a higher turnout. Similarly conducting meetings in areas with MARC stations can ensure better turnout due to ease of commutation.  

Reporting Data:
Research question 1: I would like to represent it using graphs. The first graph should contain zipcode on x axis and population on y axis. The second graph should contain zipcode on x axis and frequency of meetings on y axis. Comparison of both the graphs would help me identify the relationship between population of an area and frequency of meetings in that area. 
Research question 2: I would like to represent it using a map containing color codes. The meetings held in areas with MARC stations can be marked in red and those held in areas without marc stations can be marked in green. This can give a better understanding of the most preferred meeting locations.
